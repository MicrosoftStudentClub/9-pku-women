  "description": "On the wall are four tiles that look like colorful buttons: _red_, _green_, _yellow_, _blue_. A sign above the tiles contains instructions in a dozen languages. The words you recogize ask you to enter the color of each button in the correct order to unlock the silver gateway or trigger the exorcism rite. Since there are four buttons you have a one in twentyfour chance of doing either. A fifth tile, apart from the others, looks like a black button labeled _pray_ for help.",
