	walk-in wardrobe. The floor is ice-cold marble caked in inches of fine gray particles. 
	The prints of hundreds or thousands of bare feet criss cross the room. Mysterious piles 
	sit in shadow in each corner of the room. You hear a murmur of soft voices whispering 
	from all directions and impossible to fathom. The walls are tessellated with dirty 
	ceramic tiles. On each tile is inscribed with words. In the center of one of the walls 
	is a freshly painted wooden door with a brass handle.",
