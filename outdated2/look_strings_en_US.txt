You stand in a dusty, empty, square room, the size of a large walk-in wardrobe. The floor is ice-cold marble caked in inches of fine gray particles. The prints of hundreds or thousands of bare feet criss cross the room. Mysterious piles sit in shadow in each corner of the room. You hear a murmur of soft voices whispering from all directions and impossible to fathom. The walls are tessellated with dirty ceramic tiles. On each tile is inscribed with words. In the center of one of the walls is a freshly painted wooden door with a brass handle.
In this corner is a pile of rusty broadswords, daggers, and axes. But one small knife looks clean and sharp.
In this corner is a pile of tarnished brass chain mail. But one coat of tightly ringed mail with leather straps looks new and ready to wear.
In this corner is a pile of dented brass helms. But one shiny skullcap looks like it might fit you.
In this corner is a pile of splintered wooden shields. But one buckler with brass fittings looks light and sturdy enough to be worth taking.
The tiles on the bulwark before you cover the wall without making a rational pattern. At least not one that you can perceive. Itâ€™s as if the tiles have been scrambled. Printed on each tile is a word. Some are even in a language you understand.
