Backstory
----------

The Earth was dead. It was only a matter of time. The air was poisoned. The water was fouled. The soil was corrupted. All 510 million square kilometers were unclean. Humanity was doomed but did nothing but squabble, bicker, and blame. 

The messenger landed on a Friday evening in the center of town. It flew in on a meteorite that crashed and burned in front of the old elementary school. The noise and fire brought the people out of their doors and cars. The messenger, battered and bruised, crawled out of the wreckage and looked into the collective eyes of the crowd that had gathered around the smoldering fireball.

"People of Earth," it announced, "I bring you salutations from your friends the Selenites. We have watched you slowly destroy your home world form our bases on the Moon. We have been your hidden neighbors for hundreds of thousands of years. While you evolved from apes on the Earth's surface, we have evolved from arthropods in the interior of our world. After centuries of observing your behavior you should be able to forgive us for not announcing our presence. We were a little worried in 1969 when your ancestors landed on our surface but, expect for the occasional probe, you never returned. While we have remained hidden we have not ignored you. We've learned a great deal from your radio, television, and wireless networks. We've even played games with you masquerading as human in chatrooms and social networks. We've grown to love you. You are dangerous, mostly to yourselves, but you are clever and beautiful."

The messenger paused, catching it's breath and pieces of it's body and one of its arms fell off.

"I don't have much time, so please listen carefully. We have out grown our world, your Moon, and we bequeath it to you. Your world, the Earth, will not support you needs much longer. We urge you to band together and take possession of ours. You'll have to rediscovered the technology to build rockets and transport large quantities of your people. We have confidence that you will band together long enough for that."

More pieces of the messenger's body disintegrated.

"My time is done but you can live on. My hive has abandoned the Moon. It is yours now. You need only find the door, hack the key, and enter. You won't need to bring supplies as we have provided for you every need. But I must warn you. Our world was built for us and not you. And some of our kind remain behind. But we are sure you will have no problem wrestling the Moon away from these traitors."

The messengers head sloughed off its torso.

"This is my end but your new beginning. Oh, just one more thing. You must be very careful not to..."

At this point the messengers head dried up and blew away in the breeze of the meteorite's flames.

The townspeople thought this messenger a trick, a rickroll, a troll. Later the night the news sites reported the same meteorite, the same messenger, the same message appearing in the center of every town and city across the world.

Hope began to dawn on humanity that night.

The Game
========

Elysium takes place on the inside of the Moon. It is a labyrinth of tunnels and rooms on a vast scale. Players create characters, collect tools, weapons, armor, and loot and gain experience. The areas of Elysium closest to the surface are safer and great for learning the game. The areas deep within Elysium are dangerous and require an advanced player. The core of the Moon is the most dangerous of all and the a player who reaches the core becomes the master of Elysium. The core is one giant game of "King of the Hill."
